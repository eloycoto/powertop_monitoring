<h1>PowerTop Monitoring</h1>


<p>PowerTOP is a terminal-based diagnosis tool that helps you to monitor power usage by programs running on a Linux system when it is not plugged on to a power source , which makes it suitable for unreliable power sources
For PowerTop to work in Edge Devices easily , this a image was to be required , which is build with help of Docker image and is available at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub registry</a>. </p>
<p>Furthermore the stats can be acquired with the help of Prometheus metrics , and can be stored in internal Prometheus TSDB . These data can be really helpful for alert management or even a visual representation of the stats using tools like grafana etc</p>

<p>While running thousands of application in edge devices the monitoring and optimisation of power consumption is crucial </p>
